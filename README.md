# susediags - Diagnostic tools for SUSE

The main idea behind this was to ensure the customer could do a basic troubleshooting for common problems BEFORE reaching out to support. A good deal of support cases could be solved (or at least pre-diagnosed) with simple checks, like checking for required open ports, connectivity issues, required package versions, expired subscriptions, etc.

It's not meant to be a catch-all solution, but something that would allow a customer, even a non-technical one, to run the basic tests before going through the whole process of opening a case, getting a supportconfig, sending it to us (or trying to... we know how complicated this part has become lately), getting a Bomgar session, and THEN getting an engineer to do those basic tests for him/her.

It should be something visually simple to interpret, like PASS/FAILED items, and present generic instructions on how to proceed, like where to go to open a case, how to collect a supportconfig and upload it, stuff like that. I guess we still take time going back and forth with the customer on these basic tasks on most cases. So, it's not meant to substitute supportconfig, but rather a tool to be used BEFORE resorting to supportconfig. Basically some hand-holding to make things easier for them, and to make our jobs easier.
